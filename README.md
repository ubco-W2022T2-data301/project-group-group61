The Amazon sales dataset piques our interest due to the company's significant influence in the global e-commerce industry and our personal experience as loyal Amazon customers. We are curious about the various factors and trends that contribute to the pricing of products and their significance. By analyzing Amazon's sales data, we aim to gain valuable insights into the company's business strategies and operations. Our specific research questions include identifying trends in the dataset, exploring the impact of discounts on product ratings, and examining how the number of reviews affects product ratings. These research questions reflect our broader objective of gaining a deeper understanding of how different factors influence product performance on Amazon's platform. Through this analysis, we hope to uncover useful information that can inform business decision-making, improve the overall performance of Amazon's marketplace, and potentially offer insights that can be applied to other e-commerce platforms. Yes, we can build a user friendly dashboard with this data set.
